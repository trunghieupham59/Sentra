# Atomic Design in Viezan

Viezan adopts Atomic Design incrementally so existing renderer features keep
working while components move behind stable public APIs.

## Layers

```text
src/components/
├── ui/
│   ├── atoms/       Primitive, reusable controls and the icon registry
│   └── molecules/   Small props-driven compositions of atoms
├── organisms/       App sections and feature-aware compositions
└── templates/       Layout-only shells with slots
src/pages/            Page state, data access, and feature orchestration
```

The existing `ui/`, root component files, and feature directories (`chat/`,
`dictionary/`, `live/`, and `translate/`) are migration zones. Their components
are re-exported from the appropriate layer first, then can be moved in focused
follow-up changes without breaking current imports.

## Dependency direction

```text
pages -> templates -> organisms -> molecules -> atoms
```

- A layer may depend only on layers to its right in the diagram above.
- Atoms and molecules are reusable and props-driven; they do not import stores,
  services, feature hooks, or pages.
- Organisms may own feature UI state and use application hooks or stores.
- Templates define layout only. They receive content through props/slots.
- Pages connect services, stores, and routing/page selection to the UI tree.
- Icons remain centralized in `src/components/ui/icons/`.

Run `npm run check:atomic` after changing a layer. The check rejects upward
layer imports and business-logic imports from pure UI layers.
Run `npm run check:design` after changing tokens or atomic UI; it verifies the
canonical imports and rejects literal colors in the Atomic Design catalog.

## Button semantics

All feature controls use the `Button` atom and one of these variants:

| Variant | Meaning | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `neutral` | Reversible utility or dismiss | Copy, download, close, menus |
| `primary` | Active, selected, create or start | New, send, active mode |
| `danger` | Alert, destructive or stop | Delete, clear, reset, stop |

Use native `disabled` for unavailable actions. Disabled styling always becomes
gray regardless of the original variant. Controls in the same toolbar share a
semantic size (`xs` 28px, `sm` 32px, `md` 36px, or `lg` 40px).

Variant answers “what does this action mean?” Appearance answers “how much
attention does it deserve?” Keep those decisions separate:

| Appearance | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `solid` | One decisive action per work area: Send, Resume, Confirm |
| `soft` | Selected modes, active state, non-dominant danger |
| `outline` | Bounded secondary actions and standalone utilities |
| `ghost` | Dense toolbars, message actions, dismiss/copy/download |

Use `rect` for full-width/task actions, `pill` for compact labels/modes, and
`icon` only when the icon has an accessible name.

## Visual foundation

`src/styles/tokens.css` is the canonical source for the rendered application.
It defines primitive palettes and semantic aliases for both themes.

| Foundation | Scale |
| --- | --- |
| Spacing | 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48px |
| Radius | 4, 6, 8, 10 control, 12, 16, 20, 24px, pill |
| Controls | 28 inline, 32 compact, 36 default, 40 prominent, 48 touch |
| Icons | 12, 14, 16, 20, 24px |
| Brand marks | 28px compact/avatar, 36px standard, 48px hero |
| Type | 10 metadata, 11 caption, 12 small, 13 control, 14 body, 16 title |
| Elevation | `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `overlay` |
| Layers | Context 60, navigation backdrop 65, navigation overlay 70, modal 80 |
| Motion | 120ms fast, 180ms normal, standard easing |

Components consume semantic names such as `surface-muted`, `text-soft`,
`action-soft`, `danger`, and `disabled-fg`; they must not select palette values
directly. Tailwind neutral/brand colors, radii, and shadows map back to these
tokens so migration-zone components render consistently with atoms.

## Control hierarchy

- Message action rows use `xs`; contextual toolbars use `sm`; forms, search,
  and chat composers use `md`; global navigation targets use `lg`.
- Send/confirm may use primary solid. Persistent create actions in navigation
  use primary ghost; active modes use primary soft.
- Time, token usage, and cost are metadata: muted text without pills or borders.
- Red is reserved for warnings and destructive/stop actions. Recency and counts
  remain neutral.
- Brand marks retain the original two-tone color. Do not grayscale them;
  functional navigation icons remain monochrome.

## Responsive layout modes

Chat geometry responds to the width of `.app-main` through container queries,
so opening either navigation organism does not leave stale window-based gaps.
Messages, suggestions, and composer share a stage axis while prose keeps a
separate readable maximum width.

| Main container | Structure |
| --- | --- |
| `< 760px` | One-column cards, full-width stage, 12px gutter |
| `760–999px` | Two-column cards, compact stage, 20px gutter |
| `1000–1199px` | Four-column cards, 24px gutter |
| `1200–1759px` | Standard desktop stage, 32px gutter |
| `>= 1760px` | Wider stage and composer, prose remains capped, 40px gutter |

The AI Chat sidebar auto-compacts below the desktop threshold but preserves
the user's stored preference. Expanding it in compact mode creates a temporary
overlay that closes on selection, outside click, or Escape.

On desktop, primary navigation is a persistent `60px` collapsed or `236px`
expanded layout column. The stored user preference survives navigation, and an
expanded primary column sits before—not above—the independent AI Chat session
sidebar. At compact widths only, labelled mode becomes a portal overlay and
closes after navigation, outside click, or Escape. The logo and toggle always
occupy separate layout slots.

Sidebar structure does not change merely because a feature adds contextual
navigation. At `>=900px`, primary and AI Chat sidebars respect their independent
stored preferences across feature navigation. Below `900px`, both use compact
rails and mutually exclusive overlays. Effective responsive states never
rewrite preferences.

## Imports

Use a layer public API from outside that layer:

```tsx
import { ToggleSwitch } from '@/components/ui/atoms'
import { InlineErrorBanner } from '@/components/ui/molecules'
import { Sidebar } from '@/components/organisms'
import { AppShell } from '@/components/templates'
```

Within a layer, prefer direct file imports to avoid barrel-file cycles.

## Placement checklist

1. If it cannot be split into smaller meaningful UI pieces, place it in atoms.
2. If it combines a few atoms into one reusable control, place it in molecules.
3. If it represents a substantial app/feature section, place it in organisms or
   keep it in its feature directory during migration.
4. If it only arranges sections into a page shape, place it in templates.
5. If it fetches/connects data or chooses feature state, keep it in pages.
