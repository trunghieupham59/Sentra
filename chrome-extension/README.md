# Viezan Chrome Extension

The Viezan Chrome/Chromium extension translates selected text through the Viezan desktop app running on your machine.

```text
Browser extension
  -> http://127.0.0.1:39875
  -> Viezan desktop app
  -> Local AI runtime or selected cloud provider
```

The extension is a browser client only. It does not store Gemini, Claude, OpenAI, Groq, Tavily or Brave API keys. Provider keys stay in the desktop app and are encrypted with Electron safeStorage.

## Requirements

- Viezan desktop app installed and running.
- A Browser Extension connection API key from **Viezan -> Settings -> Browser Extension**.
- Chrome, Arc, Brave, Edge or another Chromium browser that supports Manifest V3 extensions.

## Install From a Release

1. Download the Chrome Extension package from the Viezan release that matches your app version.
2. If the package is a `.zip`, unzip it first.
3. Open `chrome://extensions`.
4. Enable **Developer mode**.
5. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted `chrome-extension/` folder.

## Local Development Install

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked**.
5. Select this repository's `chrome-extension/` folder.

## Connect to Viezan

1. Open the Viezan desktop app.
2. Go to **Settings -> Browser Extension**.
3. Copy or create a **Connection API Key**.
4. Open the extension **Options** page.
5. Paste the API key, choose your target language/provider and save.
6. Use **Test Connection** to verify that the desktop app is reachable.

If the test fails, confirm that Viezan is running and that local requests to `127.0.0.1:39875` are not blocked.

## Security Model

- The extension talks only to the Viezan local server at `127.0.0.1:39875`.
- Every request sends the connection API key through the local auth header.
- The API key is generated in the desktop app, always starts with `sk-vie-`, and is stored in Chrome `storage.local`.
- Provider API keys are never stored in the extension.
- Webpage content is sent only when you trigger a translation.
- The desktop app decides whether translation uses Local AI or a configured cloud provider.

## Localization Policy

The desktop app owns the localized product experience. The Chrome Extension UI is intentionally English-only in this package; translate/provider output still follows the target language and model settings selected by the user.
