/**
 * Chat system prompt builder.
 *
 * Two layers of guardrails are applied to every chat request:
 *
 *   1. **Reading discipline** (always on) — a short directive that asks the
 *      model to take the user's stated assumptions/constraints at face value
 *      instead of silently overriding them with common-case defaults. This
 *      covers the common failure mode where users describe an unusual setup
 *      and the model "helpfully" reverts to the textbook scenario, producing
 *      a confidently wrong answer (e.g. tax-withholding questions where the
 *      caller specifies an unusual withholding rule but the model applies the
 *      standard formula and arrives at a wrong refund amount).
 *
 *   2. **Reasoning discipline** (opt-in via `carefulReasoning`) — a longer
 *      directive that forces the model to restate inputs, show step-by-step
 *      math, and cross-check the final number against every stated
 *      constraint. Toggled by the user from the Chat composer ("Careful
 *      Reasoning" mode) and is most useful for finance/tax/math questions.
 *
 * Both directives sit AFTER the user's system prompt so a stricter user
 * instruction (e.g. "always answer in one sentence") still wins for plain
 * chat, while the discipline rules survive as a baseline reading contract.
